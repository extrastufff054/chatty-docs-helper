## General Questions

### Q: What is the I4C Chatbot?
**A:** The I4C Chatbot is a document-based question answering system designed for the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre. It allows users to upload documents and query their contents using natural language, with responses generated by AI models running locally through Ollama.

### Q: What kinds of documents does the chatbot support?
**A:** The system currently supports PDF documents as the primary format. The backend can be extended to support additional formats like Word (DOCX) and Excel (XLSX) documents.

### Q: How does the chatbot answer questions?
**A:** The chatbot uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach:
1. Documents are split into chunks and converted to vector embeddings
2. User questions are used to retrieve the most relevant chunks from the document
3. These chunks are combined with the question in a prompt
4. The prompt is sent to a local AI model via Ollama
5. The model generates a response based on the document context

### Q: Is my data sent to external services?
**A:** No. All processing happens locally. Your documents, questions, and responses are processed entirely on your local machine or server, enhancing privacy and security.

## Authentication and User Management

### Q: How do I create an admin account?
**A:** An admin account is automatically created during the first launch with the following credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Important:** Change this password immediately after the first login for security purposes.

### Q: How does the user approval process work?
**A:** New users who register will have their accounts marked as "pending approval." Admin users can log in and approve these accounts through the Admin Panel > User Management section. Users cannot log in until their accounts are approved.

### Q: Can I change my password?
**A:** Yes, password change functionality is available in the user profile section after logging in.

### Q: What if I forget my admin password?
**A:** If you forget the admin password and have no other admin accounts, you can reset it by:
1. Accessing the database directly
2. Updating the admin user's password hash
3. Restarting the application

For SQLite implementation:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET passwordHash = '8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918'
WHERE username = 'admin';
```
This resets the password to `admin123`.

### Q: Can I use OAuth or external authentication?
**A:** The current implementation uses local username/password authentication. OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, etc.) would require extending the authentication system as described in the Authentication Guide.

## Document Management

### Q: What is the maximum document size that can be processed?
**A:** The practical document size limit depends on your system's resources. In general:
- Documents up to 100 pages should process with minimal issues
- Very large documents (100+ pages) may require more memory and processing time
- Consider splitting extremely large documents for better performance

### Q: Where are uploaded documents stored?
**A:** Documents are stored in the `/data/documents` directory by default. This location can be configured in the application settings.

### Q: How can I delete a document?
**A:** Documents can be deleted through the Admin Panel > Document Management section. This removes both the original document and its processed embeddings.

### Q: Can I update a document without re-uploading?
**A:** Currently, the system requires re-uploading a document to update it. This ensures that all embeddings and indexes are properly regenerated.

## AI Models and Inference

### Q: Which AI models work best with the chatbot?
**A:** The chatbot works with any model available through Ollama. For general document question-answering:
- **Llama 3** provides a good balance of quality and speed
- **Mistral** works well for technical documents
- **Phi-2** is a lighter option for simpler documents

### Q: How do I add new AI models?
**A:** New models can be added by:
1. Installing Ollama if not already installed
2. Pulling the desired model using the command: `ollama pull model-name`
3. Restarting the application if necessary

### Q: Why are some responses inaccurate?
**A:** Response accuracy depends on several factors:
- Document quality and clarity
- AI model capabilities
- Chunk size and retrieval settings
- Question specificity and complexity

To improve accuracy:
- Use clear, specific questions
- Try different AI models
- Adjust system prompts in the admin settings
- Verify information against the original document

### Q: How can I customize the AI's response style?
**A:** Response style can be customized by:
1. Accessing the Admin Panel > System Prompts section
2. Creating or editing a system prompt template
3. Customizing the instructions given to the AI
4. Adjusting the temperature setting (lower for more deterministic responses, higher for more creative ones)

## Technical Issues

### Q: The application won't start. What should I check?
**A:** Check the following:
1. Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Ensure Ollama is running if you're using local models
3. Check the server logs for specific error messages
4. Verify that the required ports are not in use by other applications

### Q: Why am I seeing "Unable to connect to Ollama" errors?
**A:** This typically indicates that:
1. Ollama is not installed or not running
2. The Ollama URL configuration is incorrect
3. There's a network issue preventing communication with Ollama
4. No models have been downloaded in Ollama

Resolution:
- Install Ollama if needed: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
- Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
- Pull at least one model: `ollama pull llama3`
- Check network configuration

### Q: The system is slow when processing documents. How can I improve performance?
**A:** Several factors affect document processing performance:
1. **Hardware limitations**: Consider upgrading RAM or CPU
2. **Large documents**: Try processing smaller documents or reduce chunk size
3. **Complex models**: Use smaller, faster models for initial testing
4. **System load**: Check if other processes are consuming resources

Optimization suggestions:
- Adjust chunk size in document processor settings
- Use more efficient embedding models
- Implement document caching
- Distribute processing across multiple nodes

### Q: IndexedDB errors appear in the browser console. What does this mean?
**A:** IndexedDB errors typically relate to browser storage issues:
1. Browser privacy settings may be blocking storage
2. You may be in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Storage quotas may be exceeded
4. Browser compatibility issues

Resolution:
- Check browser permissions for the site
- Try a different browser

4. Testing with various examples of the document type

Example for adding DOCX support (conceptual):
```typescript
// New parser in documentProcessor.ts
async function parseDocx(file: File): Promise<string> {
  // Use a library like mammoth.js to extract text
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const result = await mammoth.extractRawText({ arrayBuffer });
  return result.value;
}

// Update the file processor to handle the new type
async function processDocument(file: File): Promise<string> {
  const fileType = file.name.split('.').pop()?.toLowerCase();
  
  if (fileType === 'pdf') {
    return parsePdf(file);
  } else if (fileType === 'docx') {
    return parseDocx(file);
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Unsupported file type: ${fileType}`);
  }
}
```

## Security Questions
